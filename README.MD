<p align="center">Progam made to easily obtain a device auth.</p>

---
## Disclaimer:
This program is inspired by [Device-Auth-Generator](https://github.com/xMistt/DeviceAuthGenerator) made by xMisst, and is made to be a Rust version of it.
And also, this is my first Rust project, so it may not be the best code you have ever seen.

---
## Usage:
This script in really easy to use, you can either compile it by yourself, or download the executable at <a href="#">releases</a>. (Windows only for now)
The device auth will be saved in a file called `device_auth.json` in the same directory as the executable.

If you want to compile it by yourself, you can use the following command:
```bash
cargo build 
```
Then you do
```bash
cargo run
```

Feel free to contribute to this project, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask me in discord `@sebas___12`.
